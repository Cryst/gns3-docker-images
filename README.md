# GNS3 Docker Images

This is my playground for creating docker images, that
work with GNS3 v1.5 and v2 <https://github.com/GNS3>.

Unless stated otherwise, these images are licensed under the GPLv3 license,
see LICENSE for details.

The images are available from Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com/u/ehlers>.

After building the images locally, they can be pushed to DockerHub.
Only modified images are pushed. Login with `docker login` before.

```
docker login
./hub_push
```
